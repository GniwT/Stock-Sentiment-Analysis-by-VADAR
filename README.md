Sentiment Analysis enables companies to know what kind of emotion/sentiment do customers have for them. This can play a huge role because companies can improve their products/services based on the analysis of customer sentiments.

VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) is an open-sourced package within the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). VADER uses NLP algorithm that blended a sentiment lexicon approach as well as grammatical rules and syntactical conventions for expressing sentiment polarity and intensity.
